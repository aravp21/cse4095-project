## IntelliCheck - Diagnosis Prediction Model

Contributors: Arav Parikh, Kaitlyn Bedard

Clinical decision-making (i.e. the formulation of
diagnoses) is a critical part of what doctors do on a day-to-day
basis; however, it is a rather demanding task given that it requires
them to have an in-depth understanding of disease descriptions
and identify hidden patterns among the symptoms. While there
is no doubt that these doctors possess this knowledge, the time
it takes to recall such information detracts from their ability to
spend time and directly work with their patients to achieve better
clinical outcomes. With the rise of AI/ML models, though, the
automation of the task of diagnosis prediction is not only readily
achievable but perhaps even preferable in the sense that it might
allow patients to receive diagnoses without directly consulting a
doctor, thereby reducing undue strain on the healthcare system
and saving doctor visits for treatments and emergencies. In this 
repository, we explore past datasets and models used for
this task, identify areas of augmentation, and describe a chosen
implementation and examine the results.
